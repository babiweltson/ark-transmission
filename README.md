# Ground Signal Detector

Found this strange transmission from the Ark. Need help decoding it.

## Setup
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed
2. Download both files (launcher.py and main.pyc)
3. Keep both files in the same directory

## Run
```bash
python launcher.py
```

May we meet again. ðŸš€
